# Favicon Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the `favicon.ico` file mentioned in the template.

## To Add Your Favicon:

1. **Create or obtain a favicon file:**
   - Create a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icon file
   - Save it as `favicon.ico`
   - You can use online tools like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

2. **Replace this file:**
   - Delete this `favicon-placeholder.md` file
   - Upload your `favicon.ico` file to this `assets` folder

3. **The HTML is already set up:**
   - The `index.html` file already includes the correct link to `assets/favicon.ico`
   - No additional changes needed once you upload the icon file

## Alternative Formats:

You can also use other favicon formats by updating the HTML link:
- `.png` format: `<link rel="icon" href="assets/favicon.png" type="image/png">`
- `.svg` format: `<link rel="icon" href="assets/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">`

**Note:** This placeholder file can be deleted once you add your actual favicon.
